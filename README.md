Reason for choosing Django over other frameworks:
Django provides a rich set of libraries therbey enabling faster development. Additionally, it provides an inbuilt SQLite database and facilitates migration from python code, eliminating the need to write SQL code. It also provides strong security as it is able to avoid sql injection and cross-site request forgery.
